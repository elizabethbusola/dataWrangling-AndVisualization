# dataWrangling-AndVisualization
Investigation Overview
The Overall Goal of this Presentation is to check for correlations between variables used for creating Visualization and 
also to check if some varaibles are dependent on another based on distribution. 
The goal of this presentation is to make an analysis of how ProsperLoan operates with the way they give borrowers Loans.

Dataset Overview
This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, 
borrower income, and many others but I dropped the columns from 81 variable to 18 variables to make the variables better for visualization
